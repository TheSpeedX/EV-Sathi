## Why EV-Sathi ?

We examine a new, upcoming generation of vehicles that run on electric power supplied by onboard batteries in a smart city environment. Charging at home and in public areas are the best recharging option. As charging stations are shared resources, Cooperating EVs have the potential to avoid unbalanced use of charging stations and long wait times.

India has seen a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) since the past year. Yet the EV owners still face trouble while trying to recharge their vehicles.

## About The Project

Suppose you are a EV owner, you are out on a trip and you suddenly realise that you have to recharge your EV. You are not sure where to recharge your EV. You are not sure if the EV charging station is open or has the suitable charger for your vehicle. This is where EV-Sathi comes in.

Our application uses a cost-effective solution for EV owners to find the nearest charging station and recharge their vehicles. It also supports booking of charging stations for those who want to recharge their vehicles at a scheduled time.The dynamic nature of the application makes it easy to manage multiple vehicles from one device.
